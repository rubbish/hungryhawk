My wife teaches foods.  Her students run a restaurant for their class.

The Hungry Hawk Restaurant is a bi-weekly event where the students serve the 
public.  The Hungry Hawk @ Home is for people to order prepared frozen meals.

She spends a lot of time figuring out what groceries to buy and who ordered 
what. Additionally, when people make reservations from the restaurant, they 
don't always specify which lunch period they are attending for and whether 
they want take out or eat in.

This app is intended to manage the data and ease the process for taking orders
and reservations so she can focus on teaching.
